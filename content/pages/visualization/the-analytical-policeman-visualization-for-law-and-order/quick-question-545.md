## Quick Question

For which of the following situations would a heat map be an appropriate visualization choice? Select all that apply.

{{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="Q1_div" >}}{{< quiz_choices >}}{{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}} Determining if crime is higher or lower on warmer days {{< /quiz_choice >}}  
{{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}} Visualizing the areas on a geographical map with the most crime {{< /quiz_choice >}}  
{{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}} Comparing crime counts by police district and time throughout a city {{< /quiz_choice >}}  
{{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}} Analyzing which months of the year have the most crime on average {{< /quiz_choice >}}{{< /quiz_choices >}}  
{{< quiz_solution >}}Explanation

A heatmap would be useful for the middle two options, because they are trying to visualize crime counts relative to two variables. For the first option, you could use a basic scatterplot with time on the x-axis and amount of crime on the y-axis. For the last option, you could use a bar plot with a bar for each month and the height being the average amount of crime in that month.{{< /quiz_solution >}}{{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
