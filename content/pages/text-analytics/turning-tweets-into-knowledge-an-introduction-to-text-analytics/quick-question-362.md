{{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}} Judging the winner of a poetry contest {{< /quiz_choice >}}   
{{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}} Flagging customer reviews on Amazon as problematic {{< /quiz_choice >}}   
{{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}} Automatically organizing emails based on their content {{< /quiz_choice >}}{{< /quiz_choices >}}
