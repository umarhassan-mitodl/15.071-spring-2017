{{< resource uuid="53ba2e1c-4dec-e92e-46f8-1091cad607c1" >}}

 

What is the correct relationship between harvest rain, average growing season temperature, and wine prices?

{{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="Q1_div" >}}{{< quiz_choices >}}{{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}} More harvest rain is associated with a higher price, and higher temperatures is associated with a higher price {{< /quiz_choice >}}   
{{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}} More harvest rain is associated with a higher price, and higher temperatures is associated with a lower price {{< /quiz_choice >}}   
{{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}} More harvest rain is associated with a lower price, and higher temperatures is associated with a higher price {{< /quiz_choice >}}   
{{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}} More harvest rain is associated with a lower price, and higher temperatures is associated with a lower price {{< /quiz_choice >}}{{< /quiz_choices >}}   
{{< quiz_solution >}}Explanation

The plots show a positive trend between average growing season temperature and the wine price. While the trend is less clear between harvest rain and price, there is a slight negative association.{{< /quiz_solution >}}{{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
