## Video 4: Validating the Model

{{< resource uuid="c47b760f-29fe-729f-6731-219318815348" >}}

In this video, we mention that the Framingham Risk Model was tested on diverse cohorts. The original Framingham Risk Model was actually computed by a different sort of regression, called a Cox Proportional Hazards Model. This method is different but related to logistic regression, and it will return a similar estimate of 10-year CHD risk.
