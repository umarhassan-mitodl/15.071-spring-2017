{{< quiz_solution >}}Explanation

The reasons for Framingham being selected for this study are listed on Slide 4 of the previous video: it had an appropriate size, it had a stable population, and the doctors and residents in the town were willing to participate. However, the city did not represent all types of people in the United States (we'll see later in the lecture how to extend the model to different populations) and there were not an abnormally large number of people with heart disease.{{< /quiz_solution >}}{{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
