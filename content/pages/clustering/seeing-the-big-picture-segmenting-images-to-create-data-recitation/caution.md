## Caution on Video 4: MRI Image

The following video on MRI image asks you to run the "dist" function on a large vector, in order to demonstrate an error related to memory. Some students have found that running this function causesÂ computer memory errors on their personal computers that can take up to an hour to resolve.

We suggest that you not run the "dist" function the first time it comes up in the video if you are following along in R. We apologize for the inconvenience.
