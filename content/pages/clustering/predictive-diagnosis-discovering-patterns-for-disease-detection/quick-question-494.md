## Quick Question

K-means clustering differs from Hierarchical clustering in a couple important ways. Which of the following statements is true?

{{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="Q1_div" >}}{{< quiz_choices >}}{{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}} In k-means clustering, you have to pick the number of clusters you want before you run the algorithm. {{< /quiz_choice >}}  
{{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}} In k-means clustering, you can pick the number of clusters you want after the algorithm is done, just like in Hierarchical clustering. {{< /quiz_choice >}}{{< /quiz_choices >}}  
{{< quiz_solution >}}Explanation

In k-means clustering, you have to pick the number of clusters before you run the algorithm, but the computational effort needed is much less than that for hierarchical clustering (we'll see this in more detail during the recitation).{{< /quiz_solution >}}{{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
