## Quick Question

As we saw in the previous video, the clusters can be used to find interesting patterns of health in addition to being used to improve predictive models. By changing the number of clusters, you can find more general or more specific patterns.

If you wanted to find more unusual patterns shared by a small number of people, would you increase or decrease the number of clusters?

{{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}} Decrease {{< /quiz_choice >}}{{< /quiz_choices >}}  
{{< quiz_solution >}}Explanation

If you wanted to find more unusual patterns, you would increase the number of clusters since the clusters would become smaller and more patterns would probably emerge.{{< /quiz_solution >}}{{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
