## Quick Question

In this class, we've learned many different methods for predicting outcomes. Which of the following methods is designed to be used to predict an outcome like whether or not someone will experience a heart attack? Select all that apply.

{{< quiz_solution >}}Explanation

Logistic Regression, CART, and Random Forest are all designed to be used to predict whether or not someone has a heart attack, since this is a classification problem. Linear regression would be appropriate for a problem with a continuous outcome, such as the amount of time until someone has a heart attack. In this lecture, we'll use random forest, but the other methods could be used too.{{< /quiz_solution >}}{{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
