## Quick Question

Let's consider a recommendation system on Amazon.com, an online retail site.

If Amazon.com constructs a recommendation system for books, and would like to use the same exact algorithm for shoes, what type would it have to be?

{{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="Q1_div" >}}{{< quiz_choices >}}{{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}} Collaborative Filtering {{< /quiz_choice >}}   
{{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}} Content Filtering {{< /quiz_choice >}}{{< /quiz_choices >}}   
{{< quiz_solution >}}Explanation

In the first case, the recommendation system would have to be collaborative filtering, since it can't use information about the items. In the second case, the recommendation system would be content filtering since other users are not involved.{{< /quiz_solution >}}{{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}

If Amazon.com would like to suggest books to users based on the previous books they have purchased, what type of recommendation system would it be?

{{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="Q2_div" >}}{{< quiz_choices >}}{{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}} Collaborative Filtering {{< /quiz_choice >}}   
{{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}} Content Filtering {{< /quiz_choice >}}{{< /quiz_choices >}}   
{{< quiz_solution >}}Explanation

In the first case, the recommendation system would have to be collaborative filtering, since it can't use information about the items. In the second case, the recommendation system would be content filtering since other users are not involved.{{< /quiz_solution >}}{{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
