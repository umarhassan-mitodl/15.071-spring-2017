## Quick Question

In the previous video, we discussed how clustering is used to split the data into similar groups. Which of the following tasks do you think are appropriate for clustering? Select all that apply.

{{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="Q1_div" >}}{{< quiz_choices >}}{{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}} Dividing search results on Google into categories based on the topic {{< /quiz_choice >}}   
{{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}} Grouping players into different "types" of basketball players that make it to the NBA {{< /quiz_choice >}}   
{{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}} Predicting the winner of the Major League Baseball World Series {{< /quiz_choice >}}{{< /quiz_choices >}}   
{{< quiz_solution >}}Explanation

The first two options are appropriate tasks for clustering. Clustering probably wouldn't help us predict the winner of the World Series.{{< /quiz_solution >}}{{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
