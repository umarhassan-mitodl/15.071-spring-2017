## Video 6: Getting the Data

In this video, we'll be downloading our dataset from the MovieLens website. Please open the following link in a new window or tab of your browser to access the data: {{% resource_link "b74c30e1-1208-42ab-9255-317e7cdd6881" "http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-100k/u.item" %}}.

This video will show you how to load the data into R. 

An R script file with all of the commands used in this Lecture can be downloadedhere: {{% resource_link "bce720a6-7289-36c3-d24d-bb2e70cc80bf" "Resource Unit6_Netflix (R)" %}}.

**Important Note:** We'll be using a text editor in this video to get the data into R. If you are on a Mac and are using TextEdit, the default file type is .rtf, so you will need to change the file type to txt. To do this, just go to Format → Make Plain Text, and the file will re-save as a txt file. Alternatively, depending on your operating system and web browser, you might just be able to save the file directly from the browser as a txt file.
