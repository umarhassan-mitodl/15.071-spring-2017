## Quick Question

A common problem in analytics is that you have some data available, but it's not the ideal dataset. This is the case for this problem, where we only have claims data. Which of the following pieces of information would we ideally *like to have* in our dataset, but are *not included* in claims data? (Select all that apply.)

{{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="Q1_div" >}}{{< quiz_choices >}}{{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}} Blood test results {{< /quiz_choice >}}  
{{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}} Drugs prescribed to the patient {{< /quiz_choice >}}  
{{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}} Physical exam results (weight, height, blood pressure, etc.) {{< /quiz_choice >}}{{< /quiz_choices >}}  
{{< quiz_solution >}}Explanation

In claims data, we have drugs prescribed to the patient, but we don't have blood test results or physical exam results.{{< /quiz_solution >}}{{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
